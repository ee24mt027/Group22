Inductance Measurement using Microcontroller
# Problem Statement
The problem is that electrical engineering students and professionals often work with passive components like inductors and capacitors in their projects. However, expensive tools like LCR meters are not always available, especially in field settings. This creates a need for a portable and affordable device that can reliably measure the inductance of inductors, offering an easy-to-use alternative to traditional, bulky equipment.

# L Meter

To make L meter the capacitor is connected parallel to the Inductor(**the device we are going to measure the inductance**)
